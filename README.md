# Full Stack Intern Dashboard - Assignment

## Overview

This project is about building a dashboard based on a design provided by the company. I used **React.js** for the frontend and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The goal was to replicate the design as closely as possible and make the dashboard responsive for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

The live dashboard can be accessed here: [Live Dashboard](https://dashboard-rise11.vercel.app/)

## My Approach

1. **Replicating the Design:** I started by carefully looking at the design shared in the email. I broke it down into smaller sections like the dashboard, sidevar, progress bar and ClaimForm. Then, I worked on making sure each section matched the design.

2. **Using React Components:** To make the code organized and reusable, I created React components for each section. For example, I made a component for the sidebar, progressBar, and ClaimForm.

3. **Styling with Tailwind CSS:** I used **Tailwind CSS** to style the dashboard. Tailwind helps to write clean and easy-to-manage styles. It also helped me make the dashboard responsive so that it looks good on all screen sizes.

4. **Making the Dashboard Interactive:** I added functionality for interactive elements like checkboxes, dropdowns, and file upload buttons. I also added form validation to make sure users don’t submit empty fields.

## Challenges and How I Solved Them

1. **Making it Responsive:** The biggest challenge was making the dashboard look good on all screen sizes. I solved this by using **Tailwind CSS**'s responsive classes, which made it easier to adapt the design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

2. **Dynamic Form Elements:** Some parts of the dashboard, like the file upload buttons and checkboxes, needed to be dynamic (interactive). This can be solved by react state to handle changes i did not do it but i can do letter.

3. **CSS Layout Issues:** The layout was complex, and I had to make sure everything was aligned properly. I used **flexbox** and **grid** in Tailwind CSS to organize the layout and ensure it looked great.

## Assumptions

- Icons used that is aviable on FontAwesome 
- Background image is not avaible so i used only blue background 
- I also assumed that interactive elements like checkboxes and dropdowns needed to function but didn’t need extra backend functionality.
- I made the dashboard flexible, so it could easily be adjusted if the design changed slightly.
